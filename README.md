# PsychophyGit
Timone Neuroscience Institute 2022 Brainhack : 

Acquiring human behavioural data through the Internet is on the rise, especially since the COVID-19 events. Often most, researchers looking for a way to set up online experiments will find themselves either using:

a) complex and tool-specific paradigms or 
b) to develop their own web code to suit their specific needs.

For this Brainhack project, we aim to develop a fast and flexible way which would allow anyone to perform custom psychophysical investigations through the web. For their convenience, users will be generating their own stimuli locally, uploading them into a GitHub repo, and we will develop a tool which will allow reliable online procedures to be deployed using their stimuli.
